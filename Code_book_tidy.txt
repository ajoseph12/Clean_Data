NOTE: variables names followed by ‘-mean()|std()-XYZ’ means the there exists six columns with a common prefix followed by mean or standard deviation of X, Y and Z.
Example : Avg_tBodyAcc-mean()|std()-XYZ would mean, there exists six columns named ‘Avg_tBodyAcc-mean()-X’,’Avg_tBodyAcc-mean()-Y’,’Avg_tBodyAcc-mean()-Z’,’Avg_tBodyAcc-std()-X,’Avg_tBodyAcc-std()-Y’and ‘Avg_tBodyAcc-std()-Z’.


NOTE: the frequency domain signals were derived on application of the Fast Fourier Transform method on some of the time domain signals
